# SquareImage.php

SquareImage.php is a PHP version of some of the code from Reddit's Media.py that finds the most "interesting" parts of an image and cuts off the rest, resulting in a square image. See _image_entropy and _square_image at https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/media.py.
